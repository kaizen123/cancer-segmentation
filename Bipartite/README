Bipartite_script: Contains all dependencies to work as well as three functions:

-createpatches.m: Script used to split image into patches, segment patches and sew back segmented patches into orgininal image size.
-demo_SAS_BSDS.m: Segmentation algorithm used in createpatches.m. Need to add Bipartite_script directory to path.
-fullimageseg.m: Used to segemnt full images which is needed to compare against patch based method segmentation.

This code is to implement the segmentation method desribed in: 
"Segmentation Using Superpixels: A Bipartite Graph Partitioning Approach" by Zhenguo Li, Xiao-Ming Wu, and Shih-Fu Chang in IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.
It is written in MATLAB with C++ mex files, and has been tested under windows and linux.
To reproduce the results reported in our paper, first download the benchmark dataset BSDS300 (including "Images" and "Human segmentations") from http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/ and then set the BSDS300 directory path to a variable "bsdsRoot" in "demo_SAS_BSDS.m". 
We remark that part of this code is modified from the code of Tae Hoon Kim et al. for their CVPR10 paper.
