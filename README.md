# cancer-segmentation
NOTICE: This repository is based on code that was written about a year ago, therefore this documentation may be somewhat spotty. I apologize for any confusion this may cause. Feel free to contact me at stephenschneider10@gmail.com for any questions.

A set of segmentation software borrowed from academic sources (citations are within code); some specifically designed for segmenting cancerous regions from microscopic tissue images. The software was adapted to fit our research goals.
 
The set includes a Bipartite Graph Partitioning Approach, a Contour Detection method and a Chan-Vese Segmentation technique.
